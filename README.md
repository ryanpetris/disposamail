# Disposamail

Disposamail is a simple mail server that randomly generates a username and allows mail to be sent to that username _while the user maintains a connection with Disposamail_. Once the user disconnects, that username is released and the server will no longer accept mail for that address. Mail is displayed to the user in their web browser.
